## What is Balance Sheet Statement

When we look at a company's earnings report, `Balance Sheet Statement` is one of the most important financial statements to look at, the other two are `Income Statement` and `Cash Flow Statement`. Basically the balance sheet will tell us what this company owns (`Assets`), what the company owes (`Liabilities`) and the difference is the company's `Worth`. Below is the equation demonstrating the relationship.

> `Assets - Liabilities = Worth`

## Assets

`Assets` are what the company owns for now like - cash in the bank, land, buildings or products in the inventory, etc. `Assets` are **quantifiable**, a.k.a they could be converted into dollars.

`Assets` are presented in two groups in the statement: `Current Assets` and `Non Current Assets`. Below is a snapshot of asset table taken from [JD.com Q3 earnings report](http://media.corporate-ir.net/media_files/IROL/25/253315/2017/JD.com%20Announces%20Third%20Quarter%202017%20Results.pdf).

All asset items listed here are ordered by their liquidity. `Cash and cash equivalents` are most liquidable.

### Current Assets

`Current Assets` are those assets that will be converted into cash in less than 12 month. 

The subitem `Restricted Cash` is usually referred to those cash that are currently held for specific reasons and expected to use in less than 12 months.

`Short-term investments` refers to the investments that could be converted to cash in one year.

`Accounts Receivable` refers to the the credit paid from the customer when the goods are shipped to them.

`Advance to Suppliers` refers to the the money prepaid to the suppliers/producers in advance.

`Inventories` refer to the goods stashed in the warehouse but expected to be sold within one year. `Inventories` is an important sign to a retailer company like JD.com.

`Non-current Assets` are those assets that won't/can't be converted into cash within a year. For example, buildings, lands and those intangible assets like goodwill, intellectual properties.

## Liabilities

`Liabilities` are economic obligations of the enterprise, such as the money that the company owes to lenders, suppliers, employees, etc. `Liabilities` are presented into `Current liabilities` and `Non-current liabilities` in the balance sheet statement. Let's look at JD.com 2017 Q3 earnings report for an example.
