A great blog:[Startup Playbook](http://playbook.samaltman.com/), from Sam Altman, president of Y Combinator.

Following are the notes I took when reading the blog.

## Summary
A great team, a great team and great execution are the framework to create/find good startup companies.

## The Idea
- Clear & Concise
- Targeted users
- How to be a monopoly
- Market
- Prefer something new to something derivative

## A Great Team
- Unstoppability, determination, formidability, and resourcefulness.
- Have the ability to get things done no matter how hard it is.
- One founder knows product, service; One founder knows sales and marketing. Can be one person.
- Have a good cofounder > Be a solo founder > Have a bad cofounder

## A Great Product
- Talk to user -> get feedback -> improve the product.
-\"Do things that don't scale\"
- Break things into small pieces and iterate and adapt as you go.

## Great Execution
### Growth
- Growth and momentum are key to execution.
- Have a single metric that the company optimizes.
- Extreme internal transparency around metrics.
- Don't need to worry too much about fast growing with a lot of un-optimization.
- Think about problem in massive scale.

### Focus & Intesity
- Don't do next thing until you dominate the first thing.
- Fast move in what you do.

### Jobs of the CEO
- Set the vision and strategy for the company.
- Evangelize the company to everyone.
- Hire and manage the team.
- Raise the money.
- Set the execution quality bar.
- Stay engaged in the business you love the most.

### Hiring & Managing
- Try avoid hiring.
- Generous with equality, trust & responsibility.
- Go after people you don't think you'll be able to get.
- Spend a lot of time on recruiting.
- Don't compromise the quality of people you hire.
- Invest in becoming a good manager.
- Fire quickly.

### Competitors
- 99% of the time, you should ignore competitors.
- Worry about internal problems.

### Making money

### Fundraising
